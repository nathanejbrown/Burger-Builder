# Burger Builder

Burger Builder is an ongoing project that I'm working on in React, which I've been teaching myself recently. It allows a user to build and order (which simply sends a post request) a custom burger. As I continue to work on it, I'll be incorporating Redux, tests, form validation, and several other technologies/features.

###### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
